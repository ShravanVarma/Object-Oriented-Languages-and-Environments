Description of the project
--------------------------

A Set Calulator can be used to Add an element to a set, clear a set, Swap two sets, save one set to another, display the two sets and  make union of two sets.


Description of Sub-modules
--------------------------

Node class takes care of all the actions done on a single node.It has all the setter and getter methods.
BST class takes care of all the Binary search tree operations and maitains the Binary Tree properties.





Operations
----------
1. Add element. This function allows the user to add a new element to S1. The value is read from an appropriate user input. No action is taken if the number in question is already in the set. The insertion should satisfy the BST properties of S1.

2. Clear set. This function allows users to delete all the elements in S1 set.

3. Switch sets. The elements of S1 and S2 are swapped.

4. Save set. The S1 is deep copied into S2. The previous content of S2 is lost. The content of S1 is not affected. 

5. Display set contents. The numeric values stored in the two sets are displayed as two ordered lists(non-decreasing order) in the output. The two sets are not modified.

6. Union. This element takes the set union of S1 and stores the resulting value in S1. The previous content of S1 is lost. S2 is not modified by this operation.

7.Intersection. This element takes the set intersection of S1 and stores the resulting value in S1
