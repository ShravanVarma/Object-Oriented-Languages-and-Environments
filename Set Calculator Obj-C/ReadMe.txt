Operations
----------

1. Clear set. This function allows interactive users to delete the current S1 set. The previous value stored in S1 is lost.

2. Switch sets. The sets associated with S1 and S2 are swapped, meaning that S1 will receive the previous S2 set and vice versa.

3. Save set. The S1 is deep copied into S2. The previous content of S2 is lost. The content of S1 is not affected. The two sets must not share any data structures, that is, they can be modified
independently of each other.

4. Display set contents. The numeric values stored in the two sets are displayed as two ordered lists(non-decreasing order) in an appropriate widget or widgets. The two sets are not modified.

5. Add element. This function allows a user to add a new integer to S1. The value is read from an appropriate line input widget. No action is taken if the number in question is already in the set. The insertion should preserve the BST properties of S1.

6. Union. This element takes the set union of S1 and stores the resulting value in S1. The previous
content of S1 is lost. S2 is not modified by this operation.
